\title{Deriving Expressions of Joint Interventional Distributions and Transport Formulas in Causal Models}

\description{
Do-calculus is concerned with estimating the interventional distribution of some action from the observed
joint probability distribution of the variables in a given causal structure.
All identifiable causal effects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but
the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the effect in question is identifiable or not.
Shpitser and Pearl (2006a) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs.
A highly similar algorithm was constructed earlier by Tian (2002).
The algorithm of Shpitser and Pearl (2006a) can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities,
and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution or fails to identify the effect, in which case
the effect is unidentifiable. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) also presented a generalized algorithm for identification of conditional causal effects.
causaleffect provides an implementation of this algorithm.
In addition to ordinary identifiability, implementations of several other algorithms in causal inference are provided. These include algorithms for
z-identifiability, transportability, z-transportability and meta-transportability of causal effects by Bareinboim and Pearl (2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c).
Recently, many of these algorithms were combined under a single algorithm by Bareinboim and Pearl (2014), which is also provided along with
an implementation of an algorithm for recovering from selection bias by Bareinboim and Tian (2015).

\section{Graphs}{
Every causal model and selection diagram is depicted as an igraph graph with distinct attributes and special notation. Any bidirected edge corresponding to an unobserved variable must be denoted by using two unidirected edges with a \code{description} attribute of value \code{"U"}. Here is an example describing a simple causal model with only two vertices, X and Y, and a bidirected edge between them.

\preformatted{
> g <- graph_from_literal(X -+ Y, Y -+ X)
> g <- set_edge_attr(graph = g, name = "description", index = 1:2, value = "U")
}

For selection diagrams, the vertices that correspond to selection variables must have a \code{description} attribute of value \code{"S"}. Here is an example of a simple selection diagram with a selection node S pointing to a non-selection variable Y. Because S precedes Y in the "-+" notation, S is given index 1 in the vertex sequence.

\preformatted{
> d <- graph_from_literal(S -+ Y)
> d <- set_vertex_attr(graph = d, name = "description", index = 1, value = "S")
}
