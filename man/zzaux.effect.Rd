\title{Identify a causal effect using surrogate experiments}
\description{This function returns an expression for the joint distribution of the set of variables (\code{y})
given the intervention on the set of variables (\code{x}) using auxiliary experiments on a set (\code{z}) if the effect is identifiable.  Otherwise
an error is thrown describing the graphical structure that witnesses non-identifiability. }

\usage{aux.effect(y, x, z, G, expr = TRUE, simp = TRUE, 
  steps = FALSE, primes = FALSE, stop_on_nonid = TRUE)}

\arguments{
  \item{y}{A character vector of variables of interest given the intervention. }
  \item{x}{A character vector of the variables that are acted upon. }
  \item{z}{A character vector describing the additional set available for manipulation. }
  \item{G}{An \code{igraph} object describing the directed acyclic graph induced by the causal model that matches the internal syntax. }
  \item{expr}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, a string is returned describing the expression in LaTeX syntax. Else, a list structure is returned which can be manually parsed by the function \code{get.expression}}
  \item{simp}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, a simplification procedure is applied to the resulting probability object. d-separation and the rules of do-calculus are applied repeatedly to simplify the expression. }
  \item{steps}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, returns a list where the first element corresponds to the expression of the causal effect and the second to the a list describing intermediary steps taken by the algorithm. }
  \item{primes}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, prime symbols are appended to summation variables to make them distinct from their other instantiations. }
  \item{stop_on_nonid}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, an error is produced when a non-identifiable effect is discovered. Otherwise recursion continues normally. }
}

\value{If \code{steps = FALSE}, A character string or an object of class \code{probability} that describes the interventional distribution. Otherwise, a list as described in the arguments.}
