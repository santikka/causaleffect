\usage{
powerset(set)
}
\arguments{
\item{set}{A vector representing the original set for which the power set will be generated. The set can contain any type of elements (e.g., numeric, character, or logical).}
}
\value{
A list of vectors, where each vector is a subset of the original input set. The list contains \code{2^n} subsets, where \code{n} is the length of the input set. If the input set is empty, the function returns a list containing only the empty set.
}
\description{
Generates the power set of a given set. The power set is the set of all possible subsets of the original set, including the empty set and the set itself.
}
\details{
The function computes all possible combinations of the elements of the input set. This includes the empty subset, individual elements, and all larger subsets up to and including the full set. The number of subsets in the power set of a set of size \code{n} is \code{2^n}.
